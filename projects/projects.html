                        <p>On October 7, 2023 I participated in Spark!'s Mini-Hack event. The event lasted from 9 am to 9 pm beginning with forming teams, 
                        and ending with the awards ceremony. Upon entering the event, I met 5 other participants (Clarissa Chen, Rina Tsegay, Catherine Liu,
                        Naomy Bopela, and Hannah Finn) who would become my incredible team members. The prompts for the hackathon were to build a project 
                        that addressed sustainability, food access, or education. Our team immediately became drawn to the idea of building a project related
                        to sustainability and began brainstorming ideas that connected to reducing food waste on our college campus. We eventually landed 
                        on the idea of an app that is connected to GrubHub at BU that both allows students to deliver food for one another and allowed students
                        to resell their orders when they were unable to pick up their orders. Our idea touched on two sustainability issues 1) students often 
                        order food through DoorDash or other delivery services when they do not have time to pick up their own food, thus creating more carbon 
                        emissions, and 2) students often order food on their way to class but are unable to pick up their food because their orders take longer 
                        than anticipated to be ready, leading to food waste.
                        Our app offers features such as ordering for delivery which cost an extra delivery fee for students to deliver the food to them. On the 
                        other hand, students can deliver food. Let's say one student is near Starbucks and another has ordered from Starbucks to be delivered to 
                        their dorm, that student can opt to deliver that order and get paid for it, thus creating more student jobs on campus. Additionally, students 
                        can choose to resell their orders for 50% discount. When a student re-lists their orders, other students can see that listing on our other 
                        feature labelled "Discounts" where they can pay 50% for another order that has been untouched.
                        We developed our prototype for our project on Figma, and began coding a website version of the app using HTML and CSS in the limited time 
                        we had. We also developed a presentation for the judges in Canva. When we were awarded Best Hack Overall, we presented our project on stage 
                        in front of the entire event.

                        <p>During the spring semester of my sophomore year at BU, I took CS391 Software Engineering. In this class, one of the assignments was 
                            this project called Space News. We were given the code for general structure of the website, and were tasked with adding a News page and 
                            About page. The news page focused on space-related news using Next.js and Ant Design components. The website fetches and displays articles from a public API, and I used various components like article cards, lists, and tables to organize the content. Additionally, I implemented features such as pagination, search functionality, and summary statistics.
